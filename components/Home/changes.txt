So, basically I took out files from this folder, that were unnecessary. 
The components folder should have components not entire pages.
Instead of 1 screen file in screens folder, and 1 page file in components folder, I reduced it to 1 screen file in screens folder.
Also, this folder should not be called Home, but i left it, because i think we do not need any of the files in this folder for the app to work as before.
We can prob delete the entire folder.
Having a lot of screens in the screens folder is fine.
